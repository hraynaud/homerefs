    %strong Why do you hate brokers and landlords so much?
  Well, hate is a very strong word. However, we do feel they have gotten away with quite a bit. After all, we have experienced the worst of them first hand. They serve a need, just like we do. We just aim to hold everyone more accountable and we hope hearing from actual tenants will be the ticket to a better apartment search process in NYC.

    %strong What is in it for me? What’s the incentive?
  We believe that people have wanted this type of information for a long time and will also want to share their experiences. After all, we hope when you go to find your next place you use HomeRefs again so please contribute, besides we made it so easy! If that doesn’t sell you, how about just throwing a flag on your landlord, that is something we can all agree will be fun!

    %strong I am worried about identity, is it anonymous?
  Yes! Even though you get to have your say, we protect your name, email etc. Moreover, we don’t ask for your apartment number, we just want to know about your experience with the building. Privacy is very important to us- all submissions are completely anonymous and protected.

    %strong Can I fill out reviews of places I used to live?
  Of course. Though we hope your memory is fresh because we hope to give would-be tenants the most up-to-date and accurate look at their potential new building.

    %strong What’s the deal with the flags?
  Essentially at the end of every review you get to throw one of three flags. Green for recommend, yellow for neutral and red for would not recommend. Pretty simple.

    %strong When will you have alerts and listings?
  Soon! We promise. In the meantime, we need to convince building managers to list here. How can we do that? Well, we can show them people use HomeRefs. So please, take the time to explore, fill out some reviews, tell a few thousand people and let us know what you’re thinking. We promise we have some cool ideas on how we will list, stay tuned…
