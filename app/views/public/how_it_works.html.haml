  %h2 The HomeRefs system is easy to use.
  %p We offer you a simple form to complete that will create a profile for your building. First, there is some general building information, which is only filled out the first time a building is added to the site.
  %p (small pic of the top part: general info)
  %p Then, travel down the page and fill out the review. You don’t even have to type, just drag the slidebars!

  %p We then give you the option to throw one of three flags based on whether or not you would recommend the building. Finally, if you want add a quick comment, then poof, you are done!
  %p (show flags)
  %p Oh, and here is the best part: you can now add up to 3 pictures of your place. Show the outside of the building or show the world a problem area, whatever you think matters most.
  %p (show gallery pic w/ the 3 default images where pictures can be added)
  %p Once your review is complete, we generate a score based on your responses and add your review to the site. Your review then shows up in the (search for an apartment-link) section.
  %p It’s pretty simple and the best part is it’s entirely user generated! We have no say, brokers have no say, and landlords, well they aren’t going to be happy…awesome.
  %p Thanks again!
