      %h2 Hi there!
      %p We’re HomeRefs, or we should say YOU are HomeRefs. We provide the tools for you to easily and comprehensively review your apartment. We think everyone should have a say, especially when it comes to the place they will live. So come in, explore and help us make this the best one stop shop for apartment reviews in New York City.

        Do you hate your landlord?
        %b
          So do we!
        Are you tired of dealing with brokers?
        %b So are we!
      %p Quite simply, we are tired of brokers taking us around and telling us exactly what we want to hear so they can make a commission. Moreover, we have had it with landlords getting away with high rents, building problems and poor management. We think you should know exactly what you are getting into before signing your lease.
      %p
        We provide the tools, you provide the input – it’s that simple.

      %p So have your say, throw a flag and let’s make this apartment process more transparent than the water in the Hudson! Well, you get the idea…

      %p Sincerely,

      %p The HomeRefs Team
